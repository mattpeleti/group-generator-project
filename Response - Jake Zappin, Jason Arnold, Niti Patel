1. How did domain models differ?

  We all used Course as the point of truth. Everything connected to course directly, in has many object through relationships, except for groups, where we had to go through something else.

2. How did your partner handle the logic of dividing teams?
  Shuffle and each_slice,


3. Remainders!
  If the group was less than the length provided, we popped off the last name and added it to an existing group to deal with remainders

4. The single source of truth was all in course. Everything was connected to      everything else through course. Except for Niti's group, which had a bug when going from teacher to group. :(

5. How would refactor your partner's code?
  Write smaller methods. We all had giant methods. We also had weird method and variable names, that we could shorten.

6. What did you struggle with?
    Remainders and repeats, as well as how to persist the data.
    We had bugs where we fixed one problem and caused another. It was hard to get the CLI to work properly as well, seeds were tricky to deal with.
